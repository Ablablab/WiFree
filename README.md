# WiFree
Free your WiFi network from intruders!

``Required``: *python 3*


**WARNING** : WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE for any improper and/or illegal use of WiFree.
*WiFree* is intended to be used in cases were you think there are intruders and you just want to deauthenticate them from your WiFi LAN.
When you **don't own** the AP, deauthenticating clients from it is **ILLEGAL** in some countries (almost all I think) and we won't be held responsible for usages like that.
